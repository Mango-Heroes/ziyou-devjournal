Originally, I started using this asset pack: https://pita.itch.io/rpg-overworld-tileset which is actually the same asset pack that **Defi Kingdoms** also started with for a **whopping $12**.
The idea was not to be cheap or to not make anything original but to *move to get a proof of concept working first and then come back and update UI elements, graphics, etc.*

Honestly, it seemed like a good fit for a demo at first especially with the tropical expansion pack that would fit with our theme of Mango Island.

Myco worked on a pre-production concept leveraging her experience of construction and familiarity with construction software such as CAAD.

Mark then worked an creating the inputs we would need in Unity for the locations to be clickable and visit-a-able:

As we progressed however, the limitations and simplicity of the asset pack just didn't feel right for the experience we wanted to create. And when we really talked about how the game would mechanically work, it made more sense to change how we were doing things. Whereas DFK had this point and click game-play to move from different locations in the game, I envisioned something much more similar to how Pokemon had worked where you moved Ash around the map.

The map would have to be bigger, more detailed, and allow a user-controlled character (Castor) to be moved around.

Mark created a new map from a more detailed and flexible asset pack.

I worked on the initial pixel sheet for Castor as you can see here:

The limitations came in the frames of the pixel sheet. As you can see the movement is a bit choppy and not as smooth as it should be even for a 2D pixel game. I'll be working on more frames so that we can rectify this issue but here is a sampling of Castor moving around on the island **Ziyou**.
